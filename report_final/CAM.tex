\subsection{Class Activation Maps}
We used pretrained network ResNet18 \cite{ResNet} from torch library. 
Since it already has a Global Average Pooling Layer after convolutional Layer, we directly create a hook at the forward pass. The heatmap superposed with image is created using open-cv.
Other Networks which already have a GAP layer are Inception \cite{Inception}, SqueezeNet\cite{SqueezeNet}, and DensNet \cite{DensNet}.
