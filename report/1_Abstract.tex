\begin{abstract}
With the evolution of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, we have come up with more and more complex networks which perform very well on various tasks. Through this development, one caveat remains. Increasing complexity of the network leads to decreasing interpretability. In this paper, we review methods such as .. and implement them.
